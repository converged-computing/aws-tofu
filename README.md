These recipes will use [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) to deploy an EKS cluster (or other associated assets). This is the first time we are doing this, so consider it a WIP.
For all recipes you should first [install](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install) it for your platform of choice, and you need AWS credentials for OpenTofu to find.

## Recipes

 - [managed_node_group](managed_node_group): several examples of managed node groups (with EFA and complete)
